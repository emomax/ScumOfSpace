	Some graphics have been added and I have started to understand the beauty of starling.
	I have so far successfully exported a sprite sheet from Flash and managed to get it 
	to animate nicely. I have also implemented an input handler which now works as intended.

	Next I will play around some with movement of the aircraft to get a smooth feeling and 
	nextly I'll add the first enemy - the Phaser.

	I have implemented a screen system to load which part of the game that should be 
	loaded while changing between screens. So far I have made the basic InGame screen
	which displays a button which once pressed disappears and the player's ship is 
	animated into the game.

	Resisting knowledge is futile. It was naive of me to believe that I could start implementing
	the enemies at this early stage. I will first focus on implementing an animated background
	and then add weapons to the player's ship. After that I might integrate the first enemy.

	All the information printed to the console was getting messy. Therefore a debugger was 
	written to more easily see what was going on. For easier state handling I rewrote the 
	former variable into a getter method using the debugger previously mentioned making it 
	crystal clear which gameState is currently running. 

	The first enemy was implemented some time ago. Simple AI - the Phaser simple attempts 
	to follow the player's y-axis movements. If the primary weapon has cooled from the 
	last laser blast it will attempt to fire once it is on the height as the player.

	The background is animated with parallax and weapons has been added as an Interface for 
	all aircrafts to implement. I also started categorizing the different types of objects
	to structurize the project more. Next I'll make sure the game is replayable once
	the player dies and that another enemy spawns upon the death of it's comrade(s).
