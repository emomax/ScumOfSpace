	Some graphics have been added and I have started to understand the beauty of starling.
	I have so far successfully exported a sprite sheet from Flash and managed to get it 
	to animate nicely. I have also implemented an input handler which now works as intended.

	Next I will play around some with movement of the aircraft to get a smooth feeling and 
	nextly I'll add the first enemy - the Phaser.
