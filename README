	Some graphics have been added and I have started to understand the beauty of starling.
	I have so far successfully exported a sprite sheet from Flash and managed to get it 
	to animate nicely. I have also implemented an input handler which now works as intended.

	Next I will play around some with movement of the aircraft to get a smooth feeling and 
	nextly I'll add the first enemy - the Phaser.

	I have implemented a screen system to load which part of the game that should be 
	loaded while changing between screens. So far I have made the basic InGame screen
	which displays a button which once pressed disappears and the player's ship is 
	animated into the game.

	Resisting knowledge is futile. It was naive of me to believe that I could start implementing
	the enemies at this early stage. I will first focus on implementing an animated background
	and then add weapons to the player's ship. After that I might integrate the first enemy.
